            <h3>Course Scheduler App</h3>
            <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> To streamline the complex process of class planning for University of Toledo students and academic advisors by providing an automated, intelligent course scheduling tool that eliminates manual data entry and resolves conflicts.</p>
            <p><strong>What You Did:</strong> As a full-stack developer, I engineered Python scripts using PDFPlumber to automatically parse dense UToledo degree flowcharts. I then developed a web application using React and Flask and implemented intelligent algorithms to automatically detect and prevent time conflicts, while also allowing students to apply over 5 custom preferences (e.g., "no Friday classes").</p>
            <p><strong>What Happened Because of It:</strong> This application reduced manual scheduling time by over 70% during mock tests, directly improving efficiency for both students and advising staff by automating data extraction and conflict resolution.</p>

            <h3>AI-Powered Voice Assistant on Raspberry Pi</h3>
            <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> To build a low-power, always-on conversational AI assistant that could operate independently on an embedded system (Raspberry Pi), providing quick, hands-free interaction.</p>
            <p><strong>What You Did:</strong> I configured Raspberry Pi GPIO pins for visual feedback and integrated USB audio peripherals. I then developed Python scripts to handle real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech processing, all while interfacing with the Gemini API for advanced conversational AI.</p>
            <p><strong>What Happened Because of It:</strong> The assistant achieved a sub-1-second response latency, offering a fluid and highly responsive user experience. This project successfully demonstrated the practical application of cloud AI on a resource-constrained edge device, showcasing capabilities in embedded systems and hardware control.</p>

            <h3>ReviewGenie (AI-Powered Review Tool)</h3>
            <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> To simplify the user review process for businesses and provide them with AI-driven insights from customer feedback, making data more actionable and accessible.</p>
            <p><strong>What You Did:</strong> I developed an embeddable widget designed for easy integration into business websites. This widget utilized AI to process user reviews, and I designed a responsive React-based frontend to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience across various devices.</p>
            <p><strong>What Happened Because of It:</strong> The tool streamlined review collection and successfully provided AI-driven business insights, empowering companies to better understand customer sentiment and improve decision-making based on user feedback.</p>

            <h3>First Solar - Module Engineering Co-op Contributions</h3>
            <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> To enhance operational efficiency, data accuracy, and tool performance within the module engineering department through automation and system improvements.</p>
            <p><strong>What You Did:</strong> I spearheaded the implementation of tablet-based checklists using Power Apps, directly impacting daily operations. I also engineered and deployed JMP scripts for real-time tracking and alarm analysis, and automated Excel yield tracking with SQL integration.</p>
            <p><strong>What Happened Because of It:</strong> These initiatives streamlined operations for over 50 operators, boosted tool performance, and reduced downtime by 20%. The automation efforts also increased data accuracy for daily reports covering over 10,000 modules, leading to a 40% reduction in manual errors.</p>
